The enforcer software is designed as an autonomic manager that wraps around the software system to monitor and manage unsafe system changes using probing and effecting interfaces provided by the system, so realising grey-box safety enforcement. The proposed approach is supported by a component framework that is here illustrated by means of a case study in the health-care domain.},

Nowadays, for many applications their deployment is moving from dedicated embedded controllers into more flexible container environments, thus becoming Virtual PLCs. It is difficult to update such containerized Virtual PLCs during runtime by switching to a newer instance, which requires transferring internal state. Former research has only proposed dynamic update approaches for single embedded controllers, while other work introduced special Kubernetes (K8s) state replication approaches, which did not support cyclic real-time applications. We propose a dynamic update mechanism for Virtual PLCs deployed as K8s microservices. This approach is based on a purpose-built K8s Operator and allows control application updates without halting the production processes. Our experimental validation shows that the approach can support the internal state transfer of large industrial control applications (100.000 state variables) within only 15\% of the available cycle slack time. Therefore, the approach creates vast opportunities for updating applications on-the-fly and migrating them between nodes in a cloud-native fashion.},

	abstract = {In software design, guaranteeing the correctness of run-time system behavior while achieving an acceptable balance among multiple quality attributes remains a challenging problem. Moreover, providing guarantees about the satisfaction of those requirements when systems are subject to uncertain environments is even more challenging. While recent developments in architectural analysis techniques can assist architects in exploring the satisfaction of quantitative guarantees across the design space, existing approaches are still limited because they do not explicitly link design decisions to satisfaction of quality requirements. Furthermore, the amount of information they yield can be overwhelming to a human designer, making it difficult to distinguish the forest through the trees. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing architectural design spaces that addresses these limitations and provides a basis to enable the explainability of design tradeoffs. Our approach combines dimensionality reduction techniques employed in machine learning pipelines with quantitative verification to enable architects to understand how design decisions contribute to the satisfaction of strict quantitative guarantees under uncertainty across the design space. Our results show feasibility of the approach in two case studies and evidence that dimensionality reduction is a viable approach to facilitate comprehension of tradeoffs in poorly-understood design spaces.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to train models locally and formulate a global model, without sharing the clients’ local data. A federated learning system can be viewed as a large-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders with diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated learning system requires both software system design thinking and machine learning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning from the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature review on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for software architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose FLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a template design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA reference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of federated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial implementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of architectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design problems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture can serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with practical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.},

In an earlier study where, having interviewed experienced architects, we found that in fact there were some common heuristics that they use, we created a simple model based on an analysis of their advice. In this paper we explain how we validated that model with a wider survey of experienced enterprise and software architects and, from the findings of that study, extended the model with an additional dimension. This resulted in our model having four primary guidelines, which are: focus on stakeholder needs and priorities, prioritise time according to risks, delegate as much as possible, and ensure team effectiveness.},

Unfortunately, systems tend to become strongly coupled over time, sometimes even exhibiting cyclic communication chains, making the individual deployment of services challenging. Such chains are highly problematic when strongly coupled communication e.g. based on synchronous invocations is used, but also create complexity and maintenance issues in more loosely coupled asynchronous or event-based communication. Here, cycles only manifest on a conceptual or domain level, making them hard to track for algorithms that rely solely on static analysis. Accordingly, previous attempts to detect cycles either focused on synchronous communication or had to collect additional runtime data, which can be costly and time-consuming. We suggest a novel approach for identifying and evaluating domain-based cyclic dependencies in microservice systems based on modular, reusable source code detectors. Based on the architecture model reconstructed by the detectors, we derived a set of architectural metrics for detecting and classifying domain-based cyclical dependencies. By conducting two case studies on open-source microservice architectures, we validated the feasibility and applicability of our approach.},

However, there are many different ways that source code entities can depend on each other in an object-oriented system, and it is not likely that all dependencies are equally useful. We investigate how well an optimized set of weights for 14 different types of dependencies perform when automatically mapping source code to modules using an established mapping technique. The optimized weights were found using genetic optimization. We compare the F1 score of precision and recall to uniform weights and weights computed by module relation ratio in eight open-source systems to evaluate performance. Our experiments show that optimized weights significantly outperform the others, especially in systems that seem not to have been designed using the low coupling, high cohesion principle. We also find that dependencies based on method calls are not useful for automatic mapping in any of the eight systems.},

APIs are basically a technical means to realize the co-operation between software systems or services. While there are several guidelines for API development, the actually applied practices and challenges are less clear. To better understand the state of the practice of API development and management in the industry, we conducted a descriptive case study in four Finnish software companies: two consultancy companies developing software for their customers, and two companies developing their software products. As a result, we identified five different usage scenarios for APIs and emphasize that diversity of usage should be taken into account more explicitly especially in research. API development and technical management are well supported by the existing tools and technologies especially available from the cloud technology. This leaves as the main challenge the selection of the right technology from the existing technology stack. Documentation and usability are practical issues to be considered and often less rigorously addressed. However, understanding what kind of API management model to apply for the business context appears as the major challenge. We also suggest considering APIs more clearly a separate concern in the product management with specific practices, such as API roadmapping.},

	abstract = {Software Architecture Documentation often consists of different artifacts. On the one hand, there is informal textual documentation. On the other hand, there are formal models of the system. Finding related information in multiple artifacts with different level of formality is often not easy. Therefore, trace links between these can help to understand the system. In this paper, we propose an extendable, agent-based framework for creating trace links between textual software architecture documentation and models. Our framework SWATTR offers different pipeline stages to extract text and model information, identify elements in text, and connect these elements to model elements. In each stage, multiple agents can be used to capture necessary information to automatically create trace links. We evaluate the performance of our approach with three case studies and compare our results to baseline approaches. The results for our approach are good to excellent with a weighted average {\textbackslash}(F\_1{\textbackslash})-Score of 0.72 over all case studies. Moreover, our approach outperforms the baseline approaches on non-weighted average by at least 0.24 (weighted 0.31).},

	abstract = {Contemporary component-based systems often manifest themselves as service-based architectures, where a central activity is management of their software updates. However, stringent security constraints in mission-critical settings often impose compulsory network isolation among systems, also known as air-gap; a prevalent choice in different sectors including private, public or governmental organizations. This raises several issues involving updates, stemming from the fact that controlling the update procedure of a distributed service-based system centrally and remotely is precluded by network isolation policies. A dedicated software architecture is thus required, where key themes are dependability of the update process, interoperability with respect to the software supported and auditability regarding update actions previously performed. We adopt an architectural viewpoint and present a technical framework for updating service-based systems in air-gapped environments. We describe the particularities of the domain characterized by network isolation and provide suitable notations for service versions, whereupon satisfiability is leveraged for dependency resolution; those are situated within an overall architectural design. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework over a realistic case study of an international organization, and assess the performance of the dependency resolution procedures for practical problem sizes.},
